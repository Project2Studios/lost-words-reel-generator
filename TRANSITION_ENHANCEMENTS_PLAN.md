# Video Reel Transition Enhancement Plan

## Overview
This document outlines planned enhancements for the video reel transition feature, focusing on providing greater creative control and professional-quality effects.

## Planned Features

### 1. Separate Zoom Controls for Each Image
- **Primary Image Zoom**: Independent zoom control for the first image (0.5x - 3.0x)
- **Secondary Image Zoom**: Independent zoom control for the transition image (0.5x - 3.0x)
- Apply zoom multiplier to the calculated scale for each image independently
- Allows different framing for each image in the transition

### 2. Reverse Transition (Back to Original)
- **Enable Reverse Transition**: Boolean toggle to activate
- **Reverse Transition Timestamp**: When to transition back to the original
- **Implementation**:
  - First transition: Primary → Secondary (at transitionTimestamp)
  - Reverse transition: Secondary → Primary (at reverseTransitionTimestamp)
  - Text overlay remains visible throughout both transitions
- Creates a "breathing" effect between two backgrounds

### 3. Pan/Position Controls
- **X/Y Offset Controls**: For each image independently
- Fine-tune image positioning without affecting scale
- Focus on specific parts of each image
- Create Ken Burns-style effects

### 4. Rotation Controls
- **Rotation Angle**: 0-360° for each image
- Enable creative transitions with rotating backgrounds
- Smooth rotation interpolation during transitions
- Combine with zoom for dynamic effects

### 5. Enhanced Transition Effects Library

#### Current:
- **Fade**: Simple opacity crossfade

#### Planned Additions:
- **Crossfade**: Smooth blend with midpoint control
- **Wipe**: Directional wipe transitions
  - Left to right
  - Right to left
  - Top to bottom
  - Bottom to top
  - Diagonal variations
- **Zoom Transition**: 
  - Zoom in to transition
  - Zoom out to transition
  - Zoom through effect
- **Blur Transition**: 
  - Blur out primary, blur in secondary
  - Adjustable blur intensity
- **Pixelate**: 
  - Pixelation effect during transition
  - Adjustable pixel size
- **Dissolve**: 
  - Particle-based dissolution effect
  - Already mentioned in current UI but not implemented

### 6. Easing Functions
- **Linear**: Constant speed (current implementation)
- **Ease-in-out**: Smooth acceleration and deceleration
- **Bounce**: Bouncing effect at transition endpoints
- **Elastic**: Spring-like effect
- **Custom Curve Editor**: Visual bezier curve editor for custom easing

### 7. Loop Mode
- **Continuous Loop**: Automatically alternate between images
- **Loop Interval**: Time between transitions
- **Loop Count**: Number of loops (or infinite)
- Use cases:
  - Creating dynamic backgrounds
  - Slideshow effects
  - Attention-grabbing animations

### 8. Opacity Controls
- **Primary Image Opacity**: 0-100% independent control
- **Secondary Image Opacity**: 0-100% independent control
- Create layered, semi-transparent effects
- Useful for watermark-style overlays

## Implementation Architecture

### Files to Modify:

#### App.tsx
```typescript
// New settings to add:
settings = {
  // Existing...
  
  // Zoom controls
  primaryImageZoom: 1.0,
  secondaryImageZoom: 1.0,
  
  // Position controls
  primaryImageOffsetX: 0,
  primaryImageOffsetY: 0,
  secondaryImageOffsetX: 0,
  secondaryImageOffsetY: 0,
  
  // Rotation controls
  primaryImageRotation: 0,
  secondaryImageRotation: 0,
  
  // Reverse transition
  enableReverseTransition: false,
  reverseTransitionTimestamp: 10,
  
  // Loop mode
  loopTransitions: false,
  loopInterval: 2,
  loopCount: -1, // -1 for infinite
  
  // Opacity
  primaryImageOpacity: 1.0,
  secondaryImageOpacity: 1.0,
  
  // Easing
  transitionEasing: 'linear',
}
```

#### PixiCanvas.tsx
- Separate useEffect hooks for each feature
- Update sprite transformations with new properties
- Implement reverse transition logic
- Add new transition effect implementations
- Apply easing functions to progress calculations

#### Controls.tsx
- Organized UI sections for new controls
- Collapsible groups for better organization
- Visual previews for effects where applicable
- Reset buttons for each control group

## Benefits

1. **Creative Freedom**: Full control over every aspect of transitions
2. **Professional Quality**: Industry-standard effects and controls
3. **Text Preservation**: All effects maintain text overlay visibility
4. **Performance**: Optimized to update only changed properties
5. **User Experience**: Intuitive controls with real-time preview

## Future Considerations

### Phase 2 Enhancements:
- **Multi-image sequences**: Support for 3+ images in sequence
- **Keyframe animation**: Timeline-based control
- **Preset system**: Save and load transition configurations
- **Audio sync**: Sync transitions to audio beats
- **Export templates**: Save transition settings as reusable templates

### Performance Optimizations:
- GPU acceleration for complex effects
- Texture caching for repeated transitions
- Progressive loading for large images
- WebWorker processing for heavy computations

## Testing Requirements

- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile device performance
- Various image sizes and formats
- Memory usage monitoring
- Frame rate consistency during transitions

## User Documentation Needs

- Video tutorials for each effect
- Interactive demos
- Best practices guide
- Troubleshooting section
- Effect combination examples
